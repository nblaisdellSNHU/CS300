# CS300

This repository will hold the projects that I worked on during my time in CS300 - Data Structures & Algorithms

## Overview
For these two projects, we were given some input data resembling "Course Information" for a particular school, and the task was to be able to sort that input data and also be able to search for the details of one of the particular courses.

To approach the problem, we built up our knowledge of data structures by implementing 3 different ones using the same set of Bid data, using a vector, a hash table, and finally a Binary Search Tree. After doing so, we were able to analyze the differences between them and decide on a best data structure to use for the project, which ended up being the Binary Search Tree. Understanding data structures is very important because with the knowledge of how to use and implement them, we're able to identify where there use makes sense in our programs, allowing us to build robust software.

There were a few roadblocks that I ran into during the development of the project during the coding process, but through debugging and Googling, I was able to get past those roadblocks.

Going forward, the knowledge that I've learned during this class will help tremendously for future projects, as now I have an understanding of how to implement these various data structures. Normally, I would just use the built-in classes provided for this functionality, and even then, I've never had the ability to use a BST, which I hope to use for my projects in the future, because of how efficient it can be. By doing so, we can apply these data structures and algorithms into our programs, knowing that they work in a particular way, allowing our software to be more robust and understandable.
